The code here comes from Udacity's GoogleMaps API course
It was completed as part of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Course
Kept by DCFW on github for future reference using GoogleMapsAPI.

## Running code
1. Fork the repository
1. Clone it to your local machine
1. **IMPORTANT - Run a simple webserver** to serve your files. e.g `python -m http.server`.
1. Open a browser
1. Navigate to your local server - if you ran the webserver above, it would be `http://localhost:5000`
1. You will then see the root file director. Click on any of the links to see the files

## Code status
* Note that the files are meant to show incremental changes. Look at the filenames for indication of order.
* Some of the files have incomplete code, as I may have skipped ahead.
There will be indications in the files as to where to complete the code.
